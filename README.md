## Welcome

üëã I am a computer vision researcher based in Ontario and pursuing my M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Computational Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Manitoba.<br />
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Leveraging my academic research background in computer vision and deep learning and technical skills in MATLAB and Python, I am particularly interested in solving problems in video surveillance for the outdoors such as traffic, agriculture, and spaceüöÄ.<br /> 
üå± My other technical interests are in data storytelling, data science model using R and SQL for RDBMS and machine learning product management.<br />
üíª I am always looking to learn something new and challenge my technical and interpersonal skills. I‚Äôm looking to collaborate for solving computer vision problems with little to no training data in the form of videos and images. I am also passionate about building AI-driven products that can help in strengthening our society and culture.<br /> 
üëÄ In my spare time, you can catch me watching sci-fi movies and reading spiritual and self-development books.<br/>

## My Projects
[Real Time Moving Object Detection and Tracking with Computational Geometry](https://github.com/javeriaz15/Vehicle-Tracking-Using-Computational-Geometry) | [Demo](https://github.com/javeriaz15/Vehicle-Tracking-Using-Computational-Geometry/blob/main/Object%20Segmentation/output.mp4) <br />
This project describes an adaptive learning approach to detect, segment, measure, and track objects in outdoors, such as vehicles, pedestrians, etc. In this project, the object, a vehicle, is detected using computational geometry, topology, and engineering physics rather than using neural networks. Therefore, training is not involved.<br /> 

[Deep Learning Algorithm of a Snapshot Mobile App for DVD Finder](https://github.com/javeriaz15/SiameseNN-for-DVD-Snapshot-App) <br /> 
This project describes a deep learning algorithm for a mobile photo app where you take a picture of a DVD, and the app tells you all the information about it. The output should be to find out the movie that the DVD cover belongs to. As each class of a DVD cover has a single training data instance, therefore, data augmentation was performed to increase training samples. The approach to classifying the DVD cover is based on Siamese Neural Network that determines if the two inputs are different or similar. <br />
    
[Image Classification of CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://github.com/javeriaz15/logistic-regression-on-CIFAR-10) <br /> 
The classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset of 50,000 training images has been improved in this project. This is achieved by the logistic regression model-based convolutional neural network with Keras API of TensorFlow for object recognition. <br /> 
    
[Predictive Modeling For Canada COVID-19 Vaccinations](https://github.com/javeriaz15/Predictive-Modeling-on-Canada-COVID-Vaccinations) <br /> 
This project describes a statistical, descriptive, and predictive model using R and Python data analysis and data visualization tools. The model aims to forecast exactly when every Canadian will be completely vaccinated. <br />

## My Startup 
[Healthcare Matrix](https://thenestio.com/startup/healthcare-matrix/) | [MVP Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xanfuA6B2g0&ab_channel=JaveriaZ) <br /> 
Healthcare Matrix is a med-tech hardware startup that manufactures an interactive AI-driven standalone unit. The unit automates primary-level medical inspection and medication in third-world countries and remote areas. It also provides a basic medical report and releases over-the-counter medicines until the doctor checks the patient for further inspection. As a founder of this startup, I leaded and was involved in the ideation stage and worked through research, coding and hardware development for all of its versions. Furthermore, I acted as a Chief Executive Officer and took business development responsibilities to improve the product and its marketing.**(Patent Protected)**<br />
